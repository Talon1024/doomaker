Doomaker
========

A new map editor for Doom, and possibly other games like Marathon.

Why?
----

Ultimate Doom Builder was originally built for Windows, and is not easy to run on Linux through WINE.

SLADE uses wxWidgets, and its map editor is not easy to maintain or improve.

Sure, there are other editors, like Eureka, but Eureka was primarily designed for vanilla Doom map editing, making it limited in its ability to edit UDMF maps.
